## Introduction
Welcome to the Based Appchain Explorer! This tool is designed to help developers and enthusiasts explore and manage app-specific Layer 2 solutions (L2s) that are composable with Ethereum mainnet and other app chains. Utilizing the "Based Stack" framework, this application provides a seamless interface for managing your Preconfirmation Gateway/RPC infrastructure.

## Features
- **Composable App Chains**: Create and manage app-specific L2s that integrate seamlessly with Ethereum mainnet and other app chains.
- **Preconfirmation Gateway Management**: Configure and monitor the Preconfirmation Gateway with ease.
- **Visualization**: Get real-time visual analytics and insights into your L2 and Preconfirmation Gateways.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up custom alerts for various chain events and statuses.
- **Security**: Robust security measures to protect your data and infrastructure.
- **Multi-signature Wallet Support**: Manage your wallets securely with multi-sig support.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (latest stable version)
- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/) (latest version)
- [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs) library

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/based-appchain-explorer.git
    cd based-appchain-explorer
    ```
2. Install Rust dependencies:
    ```sh
    cargo build
    ```
3. Install Node.js dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. Compile Solidity contracts:
    ```sh
    solc --bin --abi -o build/contracts contracts/*.sol
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Application
1. Start the backend server:
    ```sh
    cargo run --release
    ```
2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Creating a New App-specific L2
1. Navigate to the 'Create L2' section in the UI.
2. Fill in the required details and click 'Create'.
3. Your new L2 will be created and will appear in the 'My L2s' dashboard.

### Managing Preconfirmation Gateways
1. Go to the 'Preconfirmation Gateways' tab.
2. Select an existing gateway or create a new one.
3. Configure the settings as needed and save.
4. Monitor the gateway status in real-time.

## Configuration
All configuration files are located in the `config/` directory.
- `config/default.json`: Default configuration.
- `config/production.json`: Production-specific configuration.

Modify these files according to your specific requirements.
